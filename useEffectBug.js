This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with an asynchronous operation inside, and the cleanup function within `useEffect` throws an error. This can happen if you try to access or modify state variables in the cleanup function after the component has unmounted, which leads to errors like `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'setState')` or other similar errors. This is because the component's state is no longer accessible when it has unmounted.
